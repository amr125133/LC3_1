Now is the exciting part where I will guide you on how to use your text editor with your simulator.

### **Using NotePad++** 
* When using the LC-3 simulator you will be writing all of your programs in NotePad++ and then uploading them as a hex file into the simulator.
* It is important that when your are writing your programm to be using **hex values**. 
  * If you prefer to write your code in binary for practice you must convert the 16 bit binary value into its corresponing hex value.  
* The code you save should look similiar to the picture below. Note the hex values will not be the same as the picture, this is just an example of how your code should look to be used in the simulator.

* You **must** save your code as a .hex file so that the LC-3 simulator can regognize and use the file
* At the end of each instruction makes sure that there are no spaces after the last hex value or else the LC-3 give you and error message saying that looks like the following below.
